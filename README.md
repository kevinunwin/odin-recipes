This is an easy way for me to test my changes. This will allow me to send shit to GitHub.

This is my second test.
I'll draft a commit, I'll git pull, then I'll git push.
Testing now...1.2.3...


This is my third attempt.

We're going to start by issuing a commit
    git add . 

    git commit -m "INSERT TEXT"

    git pull

    git push
